coll002,spoon eyes.pdf,,,Das behende Seil / von der (spoon eye dude),Geroge Bartisch,1583,"Bartisch pioneered many methods of eye examination and eye work as he is often regarded as the father of ophthalmology. Pictured here, a man has two tools put over his eyes, both resembling spoons, most likely to give the eye environment a dark space to focus or to fix some sort of malady in the eye. Bartisch came from a lower-class German family and could not afford to school, but was always very interested in medicine. He became an apprentice to a barber-surgeon, and from there became the world-renowned doctor he is known as today.

coll003,amulets.pdf,,,Das Dritte Zeilvon,Geroge Bartisch,1583,"Bartisch was a large supporter of witchcraft, often referencing back to patients' illnesses as some kind of malady due to demons or witches. Oftentimes, instead of actually giving his patients a certain treatment, like an oil or medicine, he would instead give them an amulet that would hopefully protect them against any evil forces of nature. Amulets were a common source of protection in renaissance times, where the belief in the occult was at an all-time high. Generally, many people would wear specific amulets to ward off certain curses, and Bartisch was most likely not the only doctor to use an amulet for a certain illness instead of actual medicine. The Evil Eye was a common amulet at the time in Mediterranean, North African, and Middle Eastern cultures. It was said to protect anyone who owned it from the curse of someone who is jealous of them.",Eye cancer/ Opthamology,"Dresden, Germany",,,UAB Archives,amulets,Image; Stillimage,PDF,German,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
coll004,hair_tumor_eye.pdf,,,Gewechlen der Hugenliede,Geroge Bartisch,1583,"Opthamaladea is a book full of different kinds of eye maladies and examples. It was most likely used as a reference book for other ophthalmologists to diagnose their patients or as a medical textbook for students. Pictured here, a man has what seems to be a tumour with long strips of hair growing out of it. Both eye tumours are protruding outside of his eye and are round-shaped, and hair is growing out from the top and the bottom. Bartisch had most likely seen dozens of cases such as this, and most likely some that are even worse than the image pictured.

coll005,eye_tools.pdf,,,Curono heiling der Hugenbrunnen,Geroge Bartisch,1583,"These scissors are some of the tools Georg used for his surgeries. These could be used for the removal of excess eyelid skin or other surgeries of the eye as need be. Unlike the other tools he used such as amulets, they are more practical and less reliant of witch craft. The long handles of the dainty scissors serve the purpose of not getting his hand so close to the eye during operation. The daintiness of the scissors correlate to the delicacy and small size of the eye. It is unsure what what the symbol on each of the blades are or if they hold any meaning.

Capitel melvet in lon,Geroge Bartisch,1583,This format of flip book style use in text books was popularly used in text book in the 16th century and is still in popular use for text books for sciences such as biology and anatomy. Georg utilizes it to look further into the structure of the brain the more flaps you open. Ophthalmodouleia primarily focuses on the eye but the text starts with the anatomy of the head and the face as they are where the eyes resinate.
